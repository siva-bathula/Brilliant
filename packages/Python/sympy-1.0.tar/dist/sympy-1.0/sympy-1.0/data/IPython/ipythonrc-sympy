# Configuration file for ipython -- ipythonrc format
#
# The format of this file is one of 'key value' lines.
#
# Lines containing only whitespace at the beginning and then a '#' are
# ignored as comments.  But comments can NOT be put on lines with data.
#*******************************************************************************
#
# This configuration file is  a  customization to turn IPython into a
# very capable environment for high-end purely symbolic and numerical
# work, using SymPy, similar to Mathematica, AXIOM etc.  but with the
# beauty and flexibility of the Python language.
#
# SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become
# a  full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code
# as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily exten-
# sible. SymPy is written entirely in Python .
